# THE LIST ANSWERS "FIELDS" WITHOUT ASKING THE FIELD RULE.
# Reddens: list-page-levels: "the API says what the list’s routes would: nothing in the view-only space, comments in the comment-only one, changes, statuses and fields where the default is Edit, and adding too where it is Full edit"
#   or "in a view-only space the list page offers the member nothing to change: no Add task, no add row, no done circle — a subtask’s neither — priority, due date or selection on a row, no Statuses and no Create field"
